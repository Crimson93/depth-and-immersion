## This is the final phase of childhood. Well, adolescence
## A lot of these events will be EDUCATION based
## LEARNING: CHILD FOCUSES ON BECOMING A WELL READ

## INTRIGUE: CHILD LEARNS ABOUT NAVIGATING COURT INTRIGUE
## DIPLOMACY: CHILD MEETS OTHER RULERS AND VASSALS AND LEARNS TO BE DIPLOMATIC

## The Keystone event here is very important. First of all, it will give the final trait buffs as well as
## assign the relevant education trait to the child depending on various factors such as the choices they
## made, how well they get along with their guardian and things like that.
## The Keystone event also determines lifelong ambition.
