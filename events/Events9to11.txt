## Events 9 to 12
## This is the final few events that occur before education
## Same as the 6 to 9 events, except that the proclivities from keystone 1 will be factored into some events
## This part of the Childhood Development focuses heavily on struggle and weaknesses. The events that fire could work towards that narrative
## At 12, we have a major Keystone Event, which is a major event (or an event chain) that leads to some problem for the child that lasts throughout their life. Insecurity, Lust, loneliness.. etc
## The keystone also summarizes their focus and proclivity

## General Events 30000-31000

## If God exists, why is my life so bad?

## Makes friends with someone of other faith

## Conclusion

## At the end of the faith narrative at the age of 12 we determine where the child leans
## Dogmatic, Reformist, Skeptic, Antitheist, Spiritual, Pluralist, Indifferent
## Can use variables to determine...
## There will be an ambition associated with each of these, though which and whether it will be activated depends on education




## Heritage: Haughty child becomes Xenophobe (N)

## Conclusion
## Dogmatic, Xenophobe, Spiritual, Indifferent (Safe form of Faith)
